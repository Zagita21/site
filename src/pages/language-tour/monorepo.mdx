# Workspaces

Aiken has minimal support for workspaces (aka monorepos). This is done via a special
property in an `aiken.toml` file at the root of a project.

<Callout type="warning">
  This feature is still in early development but it is simple to incrementally improve
  so we are making it available early in a less useful state to get some feedback.
</Callout>

```toml filename="myproject/aiken.toml"
members = ["pkgs/my_library", "pkgs/my_validators"]
```

Globs are supported so it is possible to do this:

```toml filename="myproject/aiken.toml"
members = ["pkgs/*"]
```

## Caveats

- This does not support referencing local dependencies by path (yet)
- Dependencies are not intelligently resolved and cached once.
  Each sub-project gets it's own `build/` folder with dependencies redundantly
  fetched for now.
- The LSP is not yet aware of this configuration option and may behave strangely.
