# Validators

## Handlers

In Aiken, you can promote some functions to _validator handlers_ using the keyword
`validator`.

```ak
use cardano/assets.{PolicyId}
use cardano/transaction.{Transaction}

validator my_script {
  mint(redeemer: MyRedeemer, policy_id: PolicyId, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"validator logic goes here"
  }
}
```

As you can see, a validator is a named block that contains one or more handlers. The handler name must match Cardano's well-known purposes:

- `mint`, `spend`, `withdraw`, `publish`, `vote` or `propose`.

Each handler is a predicate function: they must return `True` or `False`. When
`True`, they authorize the action they are validating. Alternatively to
returning false, they can also halt using the [`fail{:ak}`](/language-tour/control-flow#fail--todo) keyword or an
invalid [`expect{:ak}`](/language-tour/control-flow#non-exhaustive-pattern-matching) assignment.

With the exception of the `spend` handler, each handler is a function with exactly three arguments:

- A **redeemer**, which is a user-defined type and value.
- A **target**, whose type depends on the purpose.
- A **transaction** which represents the script execution context.

The `spend` handler takes an additional first argument which is an optional datum, also a user-defined type. More on that in the section below.

Datum? Redeemer? If you aren't yet familiar with the eUTxO model yet, we recommend reading through the [eUTxO Crash Course](/fundamentals/eutxo).
</Callout>

In fact, handlers acts similarly to a pattern-matching on a [`ScriptContext{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/script_context.html#ScriptContext); pulling out elements for you while also ensuring safety around your validator boundaries. For convenience, here's a table that summarizes the different target types with their corresponding definitions from the standard library:

| Purpose    | Target                                                                                                    | What for                                                               |
| ---        | ---                                                                                                       | ---                                                                    |
| `mint`     | [`PolicyId{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/assets.html#PolicyId)                       | minting / burning of assets                                            |
| `spend`    | [`OutputReference{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/transaction.html#OutputReference)    | spending of transaction outputs                                        |
| `withdraw` | [`Credential{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/address.html#Credential)                  | withdrawing staking rewards                                            |
| `publish`  | [`Certificate{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/certificate.html#Certificate)            | publishing of delegation certificates                                  |
| `vote`     | [`Voter{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/governance.html#Voter)                         | voting on governance proposals                                         |
| `propose`  | [`ProposalProcedure{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/governance.html#ProposalProcedure) | Constitution guardrails, executed when submitting governance proposals |

Or, seen in action:

```ak
use cardano/address.{Credential}
use cardano/assets.{PolicyId}
use cardano/certificate.{Certificate}
use cardano/governance.{ProposalProcedure, Voter}
use cardano/transaction.{Transaction, OutputReference}

validator my_script {
  mint(redeemer: MyMintRedeemer, policy_id: PolicyId, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"mint logic goes here"
  }

  spend(datum: Option<MyDatum>, redeemer: MySpendRedeemer, utxo: OutputReference, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"spend logic goes here"
  }

  withdraw(redeemer: MyWithdrawRedeemer, account: Credential, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"withdraw logic goes here"
  }

  publish(redeemer: MyPublishRedeemer, certificate: Certificate, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"publish logic goes here"
  }

  vote(redeemer: MyVoteRedeemer, voter: Voter, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"vote logic goes here"
  }

  propose(redeemer: MyProposeRedeemer, proposal: ProposalProcedure, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"propose logic goes here"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
Notice how every handler can take a different redeemer type and all take a `Transaction` as last argument.
</Callout>

### Managing (Optional) Datum

Spend handlers contain an extra argument: the (optional) datum which may be set
with the output when assets get initially locked. Because there's no ways to
enforce that the datum is present (you cannot prevent one to send/lock assets
into your validator), it always come as an `Option<T>` where `T` is a
user-defined type that depends on the contract.

Nevertheless, should your contract require a datum to be present, then it is
straightforward to enforce this constraint using [`expect{:ak}`](/language-tour/control-flow#non-exhaustive-pattern-matching)
and halt the execution of the validator when the datum is missing.

```ak
use cardano/transaction.{Transaction, OutputReference}

validator my_script {
  spend(datum_opt: Option<MyDatum>, redeemer: MyRedeemer, input: OutputReference, self: Transaction) {
    expect Some(datum) = datum_opt
    todo @"validator logic goes here"
  }
}
```

### Fallback handler

The keen reader would have noticed that the example validators above are
_non-exhaustive_ and only cover one of the six purposes. It may be cumbersome
to always define a handler for all purposes, especially if your application
isn't expected to work in those contexts.

A special handler can thus serve as a fallback / catch-all with one notable
difference: the fallback handler takes a single argument of type
[`ScriptContext{:ak}`](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/cardano/script_context.html#ScriptContext).
It is then your responsibility as a smart contract developer to assert the
script purposes and recover your redeemer and/or datum.

```ak
use cardano/assets.{PolicyId}
use cardano/transaction.{Transaction, OutputReference}
use cardano/script_context.{ScriptContext}

validator my_multi_purpose_script {
  mint(redeemer: MyRedeemer, policy_id: PolicyId, self: Transaction) {
    todo @"validator logic goes here"
  }

  spend(datum_opt: Option<MyDatum>, redeemer: MyRedeemer, input: OutputReference, self: Transaction) {
    expect Some(datum) = datum_opt
    todo @"validator logic goes here"
  }

  else(_ctx: ScriptContext) {
    fail @"unsupported purpose"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
There are also scenarios where you might not want the granularity and
guardrails offered by Aiken. A typical use-case for example is writing
validator on an layer-2 system that uses the Plutus Virtual Machine (e.g.
Hydra) but may have different purposes and/or script context.

The fallback handler comes in handy for those situation and allows you to
define and use arbitrary script contexts to match any environment. In the long
run, a dedicated syntax might be introduced to declare handlers based on some
type definition.
</Callout>


#### Default fallback

When no fallback is explicitly specified, Aiken defaults to a validator that is
always rejecting.

```ak
validator my_script {
  else(_) {
    fail
  }
}
```

## Parameters

Validators themselves can take _parameters_, which represent configuration
elements that must be provided to create an instance of the validator. Once
provided, parameters are embedded within the compiled validator and part of the
generated code. Hence they must be provided before any address can be
calculated for the corresponding validator.

Parameters are accessible to all handlers from within the validator and can be
any serialisable (non-opaque) data-type. For example, it is common to ensure
uniqueness of execution of a minting policy to parameterize the validator with
a UTxO reference. In the mint handler, one can then check that the referenced
UTxO is spent, which, by nature of UTxO (can only be spent once), ensures
uniqueness of execution for the mint handler. Handy!

```ak filename="validators/my_script.ak"
use aiken/collection/list
use cardano/assets.{PolicyId}
use cardano/transaction.{Transaction, OutputReference}

validator my_script(utxo_ref: OutputReference) {
  mint(redeemer: Data, policy_id: PolicyId, self: Transaction) {
    expect list.any(
      self.inputs,
      fn (input) { input.output_reference == utxo_ref }
    )
    todo @"rest of the logic goes here"
  }
}
```

## Calling handlers

Handlers are your smart contract interface with the rest of the world. However,
there are situations where you may want to invoke a handler as a standalone
function (e.g. for testing).

Aiken provides a convenient syntax for syntax akin to calling functions from a
module:

`{validator_name}.{handler_name}`

The result is a function that takes the same arguments as the handler,
prepended with any parameter from the validator. For example:

```ak
test return_true_when_utxo_ref_match() {
  let utxo_ref = todo @"OutputReference"
  let redeemer = todo @"Redeemer"
  let policy_id = todo @"OutputReference"
  let transaction = todo @"Transaction"
  my_script.mint(utxo_ref, redeemer, policy_id, transaction)
}
```

### Importing validators

Should you need to split tests in a different module, Aiken allows the import
of _validators_ with a few restrictions:

1. Only _test modules_ can import validators. A module is considered a _test module_ if it doesn't export any public definition.
2. Validators cannot be imported as unqualified objects. They must be used as qualified imports.

So, assuming the validator above, we could imagine writing a test module like:

```ak
use my_script

test return_true_when_utxo_ref_match() {
  let utxo_ref = todo @"OutputReference"
  let redeemer = todo @"Redeemer"
  let policy_id = todo @"OutputReference"
  let transaction = todo @"Transaction"
  my_script.my_script.mint(utxo_ref, redeemer, policy_id, transaction)
}
```
