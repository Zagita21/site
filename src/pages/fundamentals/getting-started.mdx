# Getting started

## Checklist

Here's a little checklist to get started with Aiken. Use it if you don't know
where to start.

<br />

- [ ] Install `aikup` and `aiken` following [the installation instructions](/installation-instructions#installation-instructions);
- [ ] Create your first project as indicated below;
- [ ] Have a look at [the standard library](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/);
- [ ] Complete the [first steps of the _"Hello, World!"_ tutorial](/example--hello-world/basics);
- [ ] If you're not familiar with the eUTxO model (datums, redeemers, etc.), read [the eUTxO Crash Course](/fundamentals/eutxo);
- [ ] Complete the [end-to-end part of the _"Hello, World!"_ tutorial](/example--hello-world/end-to-end/pycardano) using your favorite frontend library;
- [ ] Have a look at [Aiken's Awesome List](https://github.com/aiken-lang/awesome-aiken#readme) and explore tutorials, courses or projects that catch your attention;
- [ ] Explore the [language-tour](/language-tour/primitive-types);
- [ ] Join the [#aiken channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/ub6atE94v4) and [follow us](https://twitter.com/aiken_eng) on Twitter!

<br />

- [ ] Try more complex examples like [The _Gift Card_](/example--gift-card);
- [ ] Experiment with [property-based testing](/language-tour/tests#property-based-test);
- [ ] Read about [what we wish we knew](/fundamentals/what-i-wish-i-knew) when we started with Cardano;
- [ ] Learn about [design patterns](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/design-patterns?tab=readme-ov-file#design-patterns) in the eUTxO model;

## Creating a new project

Use `aiken new foo/bar` to create a scaffold a new project and follow
instructions from the generated `README.md` at the root of your project. On
success, your project should look roughly as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── aiken.toml
├── lib
│   └── bar
└── validators
```

## Compiling a project

Use `aiken build` to compile a project, and `aiken check` to only type-check a
project and run tests.

If you're writing a library `aiken docs` is a powerful utility to generate HTML
documentation from types, type annotations and comments. Abuse it!

Finally, once compiled, you may look at the `aiken blueprint` command group to
generate addresses, apply parameters and convert the build output to various
formats.

## Project structure

### Folder organisation

Aiken projects divide their source code in two categories: library code, and
application code. Library code must be located in a `lib` folder, and
application code (i.e. on-chain validators) located in a `validators` folder.

After compilation, the compiler will generate a Plutus blueprint
(`plutus.json`), which is an interoperable document that summarizes your
project. The blueprint also contains compiled code for each validator of your
project and their corresponding hash digests to be used in addresses.

### Configuration

A project has a top-level `aiken.toml` file at its root containing metadata
about the projects, as well as dependencies required by it. Here's a sample of
(documented) project configuration:

```toml filename="aiken.toml"
# [Optional - if 'members' is present]
#
# Project's name, as {organisation}/{repository}
name = "foo/bar"

# [Optional - if 'members' is present]
#
# Project's version, we recommend semantic versioning for libraries. However,
# any UTF-8 string is accepted.
version = "1.0.0"

# [Optional]
#
# A license name. We recommend Apache-2.0 or MPL-2.0 for open source projects.
licence = "Apache-2.0"

# [Optional]
#
# An informative albeit short description of the project.
description = "A next-level DeFi platform"

# [Optional]
#
# A list of folders to look for Aiken projects. See Workspaces below.
members = ["."]

# [Optional]
#
# Structured information on a project to show in generated documentation.
[repository]
platform = "github"   # Platform type, only `github` for now.
user = "aiken-lang"   # Username or organisation on that platform
project = "stdlib"    # Repository or project on that platform

# [Optional]
#
# A list of dependencies. Avoid editing by hand, use `aiken packages` to manage
# them.
[[dependencies]]
source = "github"            # Platform type, only `github` for now.
name = "aiken-lang/stdlib"   # The github project, in the form of {organisation}/{repository}.
version = "main"             # Version, as a git tag, branch name or git commit hash
```

### Workspaces

<Callout type="warning">
  This feature is still in early development but it is simple to incrementally improve
  so we are making it available early in a less useful state to get some feedback.
</Callout>

Aiken has minimal support for workspaces (a.k.a. monorepos). This is enabled
using the `members` configuration fields in an `aiken.toml` file at the root of
a project.

```toml filename="myproject/aiken.toml"
members = ["pkgs/my_library", "pkgs/my_validators"]
```

Globs are supported so it is possible to do this:

```toml filename="myproject/aiken.toml"
members = ["pkgs/*"]
```

Note also that, other configuration fields are ignored when `members` is present.

#### Caveats

- This does not support referencing local dependencies by path (yet)
- Dependencies are not intelligently resolved and cached once.
  Each sub-project gets it's own `build/` folder with dependencies redundantly
  fetched for now.
- The LSP is not yet aware of this configuration option and may behave strangely.


## Well-known packages & modules

### Aiken's prelude

The `prelude` contains a minimum set of functions, constructors and modules
available _by default_ to all Aiken projects. You can find it on
[aiken-lang/prelude](https://aiken-lang.github.io/prelude/) and at the bottom
of this website.

### Aiken's standard library

The standard library (or `stdlib` in short) gathers useful functions and
data-structures that might come in handy in your Aiken programming journey.
It's also a good reference of well-written and well-tested Aiken code if you
need some examples to get started with. You can find it on
[aiken-lang/stdlib](https://aiken-lang.github.io/stdlib/) and at the bottom of
this website.
